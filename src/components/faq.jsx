        question: 'What are the requirements for a strong password?',
        answer: `
      If you want a strong password, you need to create random passwords using cryptographic entropy. Unfortunately, human-generated passwords are always weak. Why? Because humans have predictable patterns when typing on a keyboard. No matter how clever you think you are, the chances are that a hacker guessing billions of random passwords will crack it. The Password Generator instantly renders long and cryptographically secure characters. These characters are rendered locally on your machine. Password Generator never generates, sends, receives, nor stores any passwords. The auto password generator is a valuable tool to use when you want to access the power of your computer and its perfect cryptographic power.

      Everyone wants to have a strong random password for their important accounts. Unfortunately, no matter how clever you are, it is impossible for any human being to construct a strong password by typing on a keyboard. Only mathematical entropy can generate sufficient randomness to avoid a password breach by hackers. Using a random password generator tool like Password Generator is far preferable to typing a password because it uses truly random symbols and characters. There is always a chance hackers would access your passwords by guessing human-typed letter and number combinations. However, Password Generator allows you to access the power of your own computer to create impossible-to-guess character strings.

        question: 'How do I get a random password?',
        answer: `
      To prevent sophisticated hackers from getting into your accounts, you need to use a random password generator to keep your accounts safe. The password generator will create dozens of random passwords consisting of numbers, letters, and symbols that even the most skilled hackers cannot guess. Safe password generators make use of cryptographic entropy or randomness. Avoid using the most common security questions and answers to make a password strong. It would be best to never use the same password for various important accounts. Random password generators use passwords that contain at least 16 characters, one uppercase letter, one number, one special symbol, and one lowercase letter. When creating passwords, people often use phone numbers, social security numbers, postcodes, ID card numbers, house numbers, and birthdays -- all of which are easy to guess.

      <br/>
      If using a free password generator, do not grant permissions to any web browser to save your passwords, because they often are breached quickly. In addition, you should avoid logging on to financial accounts on public computers or whenever connected to a free VPN, web proxy, or public Wi-Fi. Public internet connections are often unencrypted. Hackers can intercept data within cafés, hotels, airports, and conference centers. Protect your information with Password Generator public Wi-Fi safety guide.

        question: 'Is there a secure way to store passwords?',
        answer: `
      Generating random passwords is one thing but remembering them is another. When you have a random password for each account, it is hard to remember what you have used because of all the random letters and numbers. So, you are probably wondering if there is a secure way to store the passwords created using the secure password generator. Advanced technology makes it possible to keep your passwords stored with ease. In addition, you can use a reliable, safe password manager to keep your information private. However, you will always need to avoid scam websites. You will also need to avoid sharing your password with anyone else.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Most people have multiple digital accounts, such as banking apps and gaming sites. It is not easy to memorize many passwords, but using the same password is a massive vulnerability. So, is there a secure way to store distinct passwords? You can save your passwords traditionally by saving them into a biometric USB. However, these come with risk that someone could coerce you into unlocking your USB at some point. Always use a secure password manager to keep sensitive information in encrypted storage. Password managers' cryptography render passwords inaccessible to hackers.

        question: 'What makes a password safe?',
        answer: `
      Constructing a solid password is a daunting task, particularly when you need to have a strong password for multiple sites. It quickly becomes tough to memorize the passwords with cryptographic entropy that combine characters and special symbols. It is one of the reasons that many people use identical passwords for multiple sites, even though they know that it is unsafe.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      If your passwords get hacked, your information is exposed to the public. Hand-typing passwords is also a big no-no because of the greater risk of a security breach. The secure password generator creates passwords with a minimum of 16 characters, including at least one number, symbols, and some uppercase characters. Never save these random passwords to the web browsers because they are easily accessible. Use both upper and lowercase letters in a password.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In this digital era, it is crucial to create a random password for each site that will protect your sensitive information.
