Here's what actually happened:

I spent 6 months building the "perfect" system.
It had 12 integrations, 3 automation tools, and a 47-step workflow.

Then I deleted everything and started over.

The result? 3x the output with 1/10th the complexity.

The problem isn't you. It's the approach.

[Personal transition story]

That's when I discovered [insight].
```

**Example**:

```
You've tried posting every day. Crickets.
You've tried the trending audio. 47 views.
You've even hired that "growth expert." $2,000 gone.

The problem isn't your content. It's the distribution.

I spent 18 months building an audience of 200 people.
Then I changed ONE thing and hit 50,000 in 90 days.

That's when I discovered: systems beat hustle.
